SQL table viewer/editor

## Motivation
I wanted to reuse my backend validations easily on the frontend

## Form component
- Resolve oneOf forms
- Complex schemas
- Recursive types
- Events with previous/current values 
- Extensible widgets
- Support nested deep/recursive array/objects Â 

## Project improvements
 - The form validation is now exactly the same as the backend validations.
 - Consistency between forms, validations, graphql, migrations and data versions
 - DynamoDB migrations are considerably easier now
 - Generate GraphQL schema (only types/input definitions)
 - Same schema for frontend/backend/GraphQL input/types
 - Any complex object compare made easy (with oneOf/oneOf resolved)

## Schema helper library
- Extract default values
- Resolve $ref, oneOf, anyOf, allOf
- Extract only schema values (Useful for GraphQL output/inputs match)
- Resolve recursive schemas
